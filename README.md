UV Lamp Monitoring and Control System

An Android-based IoT application built using Flutter, designed to monitor and control UV lamps used in central air conditioning systems. The app fetches real-time data from the ESP32 microcontroller* via ThingSpeak cloud and allows remote control of the lamp, helping prevent fungal and bacterial growth on cooling coils. Developed under an MoU with *Arklite Speciality Lamps Pvt. Ltd., this interdisciplinary project integrates Eectronics & Telecommunication* and *Computer Engineering disciplines.

 Features

- Real-Time Monitoring*: View lamp status (ON/OFF), operating hours, and error alerts.
- Remote Control*: Turn the lamp ON/OFF from the app.
- Cloud Integration:
  - ThingSpeak for fetching sensor data and controlling devices.
  - Firebase for secure employee login and authentication.
- PDF Report Generation*: Automatically generate a report with current lamp data, logo, and timestamp.
- Clean UI: Modern interface designed in Figma and implemented using Flutter.

 Tech Stack

- Frontend*: Flutter (Dart)
- Backend/Cloud: Firebase Authentication, ThingSpeak (API Integration)
- Microcontroller: ESP32 with Wi-Fi support
- IDE: Android Studio
- Others: Figma (UI Design), Firebase Console, ThingSpeak IoT Platform
